# PayFlex — Razorpay-style Landing Page (Static)

A single-page static landing page inspired by Razorpay's clean, modern UI. Built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and designed to be responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop.

- Hero section with headline, subtext, CTAs and dashboard mock.
- Features / benefits section with 4 feature cards.
- Product highlights with a phone mock and list of tools.
- Pricing tease (3 plans).
- Responsive nav, CTA strip and footer.

- Extra features: floating feature chips, sticky glass nav, accessibility touches.

## Screenshot

> Replace `screenshot.png` with your own screenshot of `index.html`. I couldn't include an automated screenshot — open `index.html` in your browser and take one to add here.

## Setup / Usage

**No build step required.** This is a static site.

1. Download the zip and extract, or clone the repo (if you upload to GitHub).
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. To serve locally (optional), from the project root run a simple static server, for example:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - Node (http-server): `npx http-server -p 8000`
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to view.

PayFlex — Razorpay-style Landing Page (Static)
​​Site:-  https://aditirajput2114.github.io/razorpay_landing_page/


A single-page static landing page inspired by Razorpay's clean, modern UI. Built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and designed to be responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop.

 What I built

- Hero section with headline, subtext, CTAs and dashboard mock.
- Features / benefits section with 4 feature cards.
- Product highlights with a phone mock and list of tools.
- Pricing tease (3 plans).
- Responsive nav, CTA strip and footer.
- Modal demo and basic interactivity (mobile menu, modal).
- Extra features: floating feature chips, sticky glass nav, accessibility touches.
